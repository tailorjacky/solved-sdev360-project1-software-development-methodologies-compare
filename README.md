This homework will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the various software development methodologies.

Assignment Details

The week 1 content readings provided several software development methodologies including Traditional, Agile, DevOps and Secure Development Lifecycle. Select two of these overarching methodologies to compare and contrast.

When comparing, talk about the high level concepts, and as applicable, key terms (e.g. continuous delivery if you selected DevOps) of each. Then, drill down to discuss some specific models. For example, if you selected Traditional, you would probably talk in more detail about the Waterfall or Iterative models.  If you selected Agile, you would talk more about Extreme Programming or other models.

Be sure to discuss similarities and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages for the two overarching methodologies you selected.

<strong>Page Length</strong>: The document, including the Title page, should be between 5 and 8 pages.
